# Driving allowance APP
A litle project i did to learn myself React Native.
This app was created related to my work at Telia/Get, where we manually had to calculate the cost and note down each trip we did to the different housing associations.

## User guide
User enters the location he has worked at, kilometers on the vehicle before and after work, and the amount of toll booths that have been passed.

For further development i would add integration with google maps, and store the data in an database.
Maybe also have an excel export of the data if wanted so it can be passed to the supervisor.
