# Driving allowance APP
A litle project i did to learn myself React Native.
This app was created related to my work at Telia/Get, where we manually had to calculate the cost and note down each trip we did to the different housing associations.

## User guide
User enters what location he has worked at, kilometers on the vehicle before and after work, and how many toll booths have been passed.

For further development i would add integration with google maps, store the data in an database.
